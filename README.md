# HR Data Analytics
Problem Statement:<br>
In a company there are around 4500 employees and every year 15% employees are leaving the company.We have to analyze the reason as well as we will predict based on the feature if employee will leave the company or not.<br><br>
In this project first I have analyzed the reason for attrition in the company and then I have built the model.<br>
I have used Decision Tree Classifier to build the model.
